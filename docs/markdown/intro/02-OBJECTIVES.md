## Objectives

This academy is **NOT**:

* ❌ a **Python 101 (_fundamentals_)** training

* ❌ nor a **LangChain 101 (_fundamentals_)** dedicated training


But instead:

* ✅ a **practical guide** 

* ✅ a set of **scoped labs** 

 so you can jump into any Python project, and understand the basics about its ecosystem, and how to start editing it.
